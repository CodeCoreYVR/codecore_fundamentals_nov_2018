/**
 * The scape character is the
 * back slash (\)
 */

// this will no be understood
// by the progra,
// "... and i said "WHAAAAA???""

// i'm going to fix that challenge
// with the escape charatcer
"... and i said \"WHAAAAA???\""

// another way to solve this problem
// is by using a combination
// of double and single quotes
'... and i said "WHAAAAA???"'

"Hi there, I'm Arturo"
'Hi there, I\'m Arturo'

"Hello there,\n I'm Arturo"
// this will print:
// Hello there,
//  I'm Arturo

" hi \\ there " // this will escape the escape character
